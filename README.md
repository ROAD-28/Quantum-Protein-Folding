# Project Title: Quantum Computing-Optimized Protein Folding via Lattice Models
# Project Description: This protein folding algorithm project explores how the application of quantum computing to the protein folding problem is dealth with through a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. Through the utilization of a simplified tetrahedral latttice model alongside a CVaR-optimized Variational Quantum Eigeinsolver (otherwise known as VQE), the algorithm would encode amino acid sequences into their subsequent binary folding patterns, seeking configurations that are low-energy. From this implementation, lattice encoding, Hamiltonian designs, quantum circuits, and their aligned simulations, are all included.
