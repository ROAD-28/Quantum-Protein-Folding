# Project Title:
Quantum Computing-Optimized Protein Folding via Lattice Models
# Project Description:
This protein folding algorithm project explores how the application of quantum computing to the protein folding problem is dealth with through a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. Through the utilization of a simplified tetrahedral latttice model alongside a CVaR-optimized Variational Quantum Eigeinsolver (otherwise known as VQE), the algorithm would encode amino acid sequences into their subsequent binary folding patterns, seeking configurations that are low-energy. From this implementation, lattice encoding, Hamiltonian designs, quantum circuits, and their aligned simulations, are all included.

# Cloning Instructions:
In order to clone via GitHub, one must do the following:
Step 1: Ensure that you have the GitHub website on, have Visual Studio Code (VSC) downloaded, and have your GitHub account connected to VSC. Make sure to have the GitHub Extension in VSC.
Step 2: Create a repository on GitHub, then copy the https link from the repository (from the green <> Code button).
Step 3: Open VSC and find the remote repositories. You should find and select the search bar/magnifying glass.
Step 4: Paste the repository URL and find the folder where the repository should be cloned, then open the repository.
# Running Existing Code/Script Insturctions:
Step 1: Ensure that you have the GitHub website on, have Visual Studio Code (VSC) downloaded, and have your GitHub account connected to VSC. 
Step 2: Ensure that you have followed the steps for cloning a GitHub repository.
Step 3: Explore and research what is currently active on VSC. You should find that your repository, once implemented onto VSC, has a README.md.
Step 4: Ensure that you can create a new file. If you need to also install dependencies, use the terminal and install them accordingly. (For the purposes of these instructions, the dependencies will be correlated to Python due to project relevance.)
Step 5: Run from the terminal through Python.
Step 6: If you wish to save progress, look at VSC and click the "Save All" button where the icons are located on the left column. To find it on GitHub, look once more on the left column and "Commit & Pull" with a respective message. All coding progress should be saved onto the GitHub website.
